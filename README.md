# SPIS15-Project-RPi-Taylor-Anthony
This project involves the usage of Raspberry Pi.

The idea is to have a Raspberry Pi robot be able to navigate through a maze, all the way to the end. The maze is constructed using black tape. This is important because the robot will be solving the maze using 5 line sensors, which operate based on infrared emmitors and detectors. When the emmitor sends out light in the infrared region, it will be absorbed by the black tape and not reflect back; on the other hand, light will be reflected on white/non-black surfaces. Using these line sensors, the robot can be programmed to turn or go straight depending on the conditional statements and all five sensors. The program also employs the right hand rule to solve the maze, which guarantees a solution every time, even if it may not necessarily be the most efficient.
